# Advent of Code

This repository holds my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

The folders are structured as follows:
* year of the Advent of Code
* language used to solve the puzzles
* day of the puzzle

This means e.g. `2022/rust/03` is the solution to the third day of the Advent of Code 2022, written in Rust.

## Finished years
