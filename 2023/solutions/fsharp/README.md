Place your input.txt with the input provided by Advent of Code into the directory you plan to run the code from, e.g. `2023/fsharp/`
and run `dotnet run --project <day>` to get the solution.

To run tests, use the project in the test subfolder `dotnet run --project <day>/test`.

To create a new day run `dotnet new console -lang F# -o <day> -n Day<day>` and copy the `paket.references`.
To create tests for a day copy and adjust them from another day, the official expecto template seems to be a bit out of date.
