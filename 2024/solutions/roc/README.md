# README

Because of how the roc language server works, you have to manually start the roc language server
after you created the container initially. You can do this via the vscode action
"Roc (unofficial): Start Language Server".

To run the project, cd into the day folder and run `roc dev -- <path_to_input>`.
To run tests, cd into the day folder and run `roc test` or run `test-all.sh` to run tests for all days.
